        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>Here are the basic rules for each of the games available on Pass n Play. Enjoy!</p>
        
        <h3>Tic Tac Toe</h3>
        <p>The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking their symbol (X or O) in an empty cell. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins. If all cells are filled and no one has won, the game is a draw.</p>

        <h3>Connect Four</h3>
        <p>Connect Four is played on a vertical grid. Players take turns dropping colored discs from the top into the grid. The goal is to get four of your discs in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The first player to do this wins the game. If the grid fills up without anyone getting four in a row, the game is a draw.</p>

        <h3>Flappy Bird</h3>
        <p>Flappy Bird is an arcade-style game where you control a bird that must navigate through vertical pipes. The bird moves forward automatically, and you tap the screen (or press the space bar) to make the bird fly upwards. The goal is to avoid hitting the pipes and make it as far as possible without crashing. The game ends when the bird hits a pipe or the ground.</p>

        <h3>Chess</h3>
        <p>Chess is a strategic game played on an 8x8 board with 16 pieces for each player. Each piece moves in its own unique way. The goal is to checkmate your opponent's king, which means placing it under attack where it cannot escape. You can move pieces, capture your opponent's pieces, and try to control the center of the board. Remember that Chess requires a lot of strategy and patience!</p>
        
        <p>Enjoy playing and have fun!</p>
